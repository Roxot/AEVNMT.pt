These training scripts are for the IWSLT14 de-en dataset.

### Preprocessing

The dataset and preprocessing is identical to JoeyNMT. See [This preprocessing script](https://github.com/joeynmt/joeynmt/blob/master/scripts/get_iwslt14_bpe.sh).
The bash scripts in this folder assume the preprocessed dataset is located in `./iwslt14/data/`
